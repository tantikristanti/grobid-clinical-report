# Annotation guidelines for the _organization-medical-report_ model

## Introduction

For the following guidelines, we first need to generate the training data as explained [here](../Training-the-medical-report-models.md#generation-of-training-data).

In __grobid-medical-report__, the document __organization-medical-report__ corresponds to the information of organization structures. 

For identifying the exact pieces of information to be part of the `organization-medical-report` segments, see the [Annotation guidelines of the left-note-medical-report model](left-note-medical-report.md).

For the organization-medical-report model, we use the following TEI elements:

* `<affiliation>` for the affiliation information
* `<org>` for the organization name
  * `<org type="institution">` for the name of the institution
  * `<org type="department">` for the name of the department
  * `<org type="administration">` for the name of the administration
* `<address>` for the address elements of affiliations
* `<email>` for the email information of affiliations
* `<phone>` for the phone number of affiliations
* `<fax>` for the fax number of affiliations
* `<ptr type="web">` for the web URL
* `<medic>` for the list of medics
* `<note type="short">` for the any short notes in the header part

> Note that the mark-up follows approximatively the [TEI](http://www.tei-c.org) when used for inline encoding. 
> It is recommended to study first the existing training documents for the __organization-medical-report__ model (`grobid/grobid-trainer/resources/dataset/organization-medical-report`) to see some examples of how these elements should be used.


## Analysis

The following sections provide detailed information and examples on how to handle certain typical cases.

### Space and new lines

Spaces and a new line in the XML annotated files are not significant and will be all considered by the XML parser as the default separator. So it is possible to add and remove freely space characters and new lines to improve the readability of the annotated document without any impacts. 

Similarly, line break tags `<lb/>` are present in the generated XML training data, but they will be considered as a default separator by the XML parser. They are indicated to help the annotator to identify a piece of text in the original PDF if necessary. Actual line breaks are identified in the PDF and added by aligning the XML/TEI with the feature file generated in parallel which contains all the PDF layout information. 

### Organization names

All the mentions of organization names are labeled under `<orgName>`. [Place](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-org.html) provides information about an identifiable organization name.

```xml

    <orgName>HÃ´pital de jour</orgName> : <lb/>
    Tel : (33) 01.02.03.04.05
```

### Medics

All mentions of medics (i.e. medical practitioners) are labeled with `<medic>`, including possible repetition of the medics in the correspondence section. The medic information might be more detailed in the correspondence part and it will be then part of the job of Grobid to identify repeated medics and to "merge" them.
The information contained therein will be extracted further by the [name-medic](medic.md) model.

```xml
    <person>
        <medic>
            Docteur Nathalie DUPONT (MCU-PH) <lb/>
            Tel. 07.12.12.12.12 <lb/>
            nathalie.dupont@aphp.fr <lb/>
            Chef de service <lb/>
        </medic>
    </person>
```

As illustrated above, titles and roles (e.g. Ph.D., MD, Dr., MCU-PH, PH, Chef de service), addresses, emails, phones must be **included** in the medic field.

### Place names

All the mentions of place names are labeled under `<place>`. [Place](https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-place.html) provides information about an identifiable place name.

```xml
    <place>
        Chirurgie CHB1 : 01.12.13.14.15 <lb/>
    </place>
```
